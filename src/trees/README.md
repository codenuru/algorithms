# Trees

## Introduction to Trees

recursive data structure
A list or collection with the restriction that insertion can be performed at one end(rear) and deletion can be performed at other end(front).

depth of x: Number of edges in path from root to x

height of x: number of edges in longest path from x to a leaf

height of tree: height of root node

### Type of trees

- [`Binary Tree`](https://github.com/codenuru/algorithms/tree/master/src/trees/BINARYTREE.md) : a tree in which each node can have at most 2 children
- [`Binary Search Tree`](https://github.com/codenuru/algorithms/tree/master/src/trees/BST.md)
- Binary Heap
- Hashing

### Terms in usage on trees

- root
- children
- parent
- sibling: have some parent
- leaf: has no child
- ancestor
- descendent
- cousin

## Applications

- Storing naturally hierarchical data(file system)
- Organize data for quick search, insertion, deletion(Binary Search trees)
- Trie(dictionary)
- Network routing algorithms

# Binary Search Tree

## Introduction to Binary Search Tree

Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree whose main function is to search a specific element.
Binary Search Tree is a Binary Tree with the following additional properties: 
1. The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node’s key. 
2. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key. 
3. The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.

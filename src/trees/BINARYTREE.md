# Binary Tree

## Introduction to Binary Trees

### Binary Tree Properties

The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ = 2<sup>l</sup>.

Maximum number of nodes = 2<sup>h + 1</sup> – 1.
Here h is height of a tree. Height is considered
as the maximum number of edges on a path from root to leaf.

Minimum possible height =  ceil(Log<sub>2</sub>(n+1)) - 1

In Binary tree, number of leaf nodes is always one
more than nodes with two children.

Basic Operation On Binary Tree:

- Inserting an element.
- Removing an element.
- Searching for an element.
- Traversing an element.

## Time Complexity of Tree Traversal: O(n)

#### Auxiliary Operation On Binary Tree

- Finding the height of the tree.
- Find the level of the tree.
- Finding the size of the entire tree.

## Applications of Binary Tree

- Huffman coding trees are used in data compression algorithms.
- Priority Queue is another application of binary tree that is used for searching maximum or minimum in O(logn) time complexity.
- In compilers, Expression Trees are used which is an application of binary tree.

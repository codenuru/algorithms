# Doubly Linked List

## Complexity

Complexity for doubly linked lists

- Insert at beginning or end Time Complexity (AVG) Θ(1)
- Insert at beginning or end Time Complexity (Worst) Θ(1)
- Deletion Time Complexity (Worst) Θ(1)
- Deletion Time Complexity (AVG) Θ(1)
- Deletion Time Complexity (Worst) Θ(1)
- Space Complexity O(1)
- Search Time Complexity (Worst) Θ(n)
- Search Time Complexity (AVG) Θ(n)
- Access Time Complexity (Worst) Θ(n)
- Access Time Complexity (AVG) Θ(n)

## Advantages

- Reverse Look-up
- It saves time as we can traverse in both directions.
- It utilizes memory as we can construct and delete nodes according to our needs.
- Insertion and deletion of the node become efficient if the position is given.

## Disadvantages

- Extra memory for pointer to previous node
- Insertion and deletion take more time because extra pointers need to be maintained.

## Applications of Doubly Linked List

- Doubly linked list can be used in navigation systems where both forward and backward traversal is required.
- It can be used to implement different tree data structures.
- It can be used to implement undo/redo operations.
- Doubly linked lists are used in web page navigation in both forward and backward directions.
- It can be used in games like a deck of cards.
